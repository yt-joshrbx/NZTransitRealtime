# NZTransitRealtime

This page is being design to show real time services across the Bus, Train and Ferry networks in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, with additional operators coming in the future.

If you are seeing this page/message that means there is an issue with displaying the main site page. Don't fret, it is being worked on and hopefully the next time you visit will be working again!
